Detect time sequence column: SORTING ALGTORITHM

Professor Rick Sanchez was doing an experiment. He was watching UFOs in the sky and writing down thier speed in fixed intervals of time. He used Mikrosoft Exel spreadsheet for this. Unfortunately, he left his laptop for a second, and Jerry shuffled rows and columns of the table. Rick still has all his data, but in shuffled order. An he doesn't know, which column corresponds to time measurements now. Help Rick to find the column with time measurement. (Maybe sorting will help? Implement your own!) 

You are given input.csv file with real-valued measurements in CSV format. Find the column which corresponds time and write its 0-based index to output.txt. There's always only one correct answer. NB Consider floating-point comparison with accuracy 1e-4 if needed
